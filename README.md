Classroom example code from Lecture 25 [MPI, OpenACC]

Part 1 covers MPI, and Part 2 covers OpenACC as well as hybrid programming.

Examples covered in slides could be found under the ``Part 1 Examples`` and the ``Part 2 Examples`` folders.

On CCV, before compilation, load the latest gcc module with ``module load gcc/7.2``. Follow the additional instructions provided in the ``.cpp`` files for proper compilation of source codes.

When running computationally heavy multi-threaded applications, be sure to request a compute node. Recall that you can request an interactive session using the `interact` command or issue a batch job using the `sbatch` command.
